# pink-lang

A high level programming language that compiles to native


## What is pink-lang?

pink-lang is a (kind of) functional programming language with incredible performance.

### [The Standard Library](STD.md)


# Features

## Type inference

pink-lang infers your types and automatically uses generics for each function, so you can call a function with a String, a Number, or a Function, anything really.

## Foreign Function Interface

Because of the format of code generated by pink-lang, it's very interoperable with C++. For example, if I wanted to create a pink-lang function in C++ that printed out a value, and returned the value, it would look like this.

```c++
// the name of the function is `Put`
class Put : public Function {
public:
    template<typename A>
    auto call(A a) {
	Println().call(a) // call pink-lang's print
        return a;
    }
};
```

If you wanted to avoid using any of pink-lang's tools, you can do it yourself.

```c++
// the name of the function is `Put`
class Put : public Function {
public:
    template<typename A>
    auto call(A a) {
	cout << a.get_string() << endl; // get data from a and print it
        return a;
    }
};
```

Here's a function that allows for composing any number of functions together!
```c++
#pragma once
#include <iostream>
#include "std/function.cpp"
#include "std/io.cpp"
#include "std/error.cpp"
#include "std/data.cpp"
#include "std/logic.cpp"
using namespace std;

namespace compose {
    class Compose : public Function {
    public:
        template<typename A>
        auto call(A a) {
            return a;
        }

        template<typename A, typename... Args>
        auto call(A a, Args... args) {
            return Pipe().call(a, this->call(args...));
        }
    };
}
```


See how easy that was?

All you have to do to use that in pink-lang is to include your c++ file with the `Include["name_of_file.cpp"]` statement!

## Simplicity and Speed

pink-lang is blazingly fast, and it's very simple too. There are only 4 datatypes: `String`, `Number`, `Pair`, and `None`.

To get command-line arguments, all one has to do is give their main function a parameter to receive them as a linked list.

```clj
main = your_parameter_name_here.(
	Println[your_parameter_name_here]
)
```

Super easy!

## Program manager

pink-lang's program manager is incredibly easy to use. To create a new project, use `make project path="path/to/new/project"`. This command will generate this structure at the specified path.

```

│   └── std
│       ├── compose.cpp
│       ├── data.cpp

```

`pf` is the pink-lang compiler and `run` is a bash script that compiles and runs your program. Your pink-lang code is stored in the `src` directory. Any C++ file that you want to use in your program goes into the `include` directory, but not under `include/std`!

There is no unified system installation of pink-lang, so each project contains all the depencies it will ever need. This makes it very easy to give to someone else to compile, they won't have to install anything extra to compile your program.

If your project's `std` is out of date, you can `git pull`, and `make install; ./floyd update "path/to/project"`.


# Running pink-lang

### Requirements

Python3, pip, g++ with C++14 support, and make.

### Installing

I haven't built support for Windows yet, but it's on the way. This installation will work for Linux/MacOS machines that have met the above requirements.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/pink-lang # Download pink-lang
cd pink-lang

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

./floyd project "../new_project" # Make new pink-lang project in ~/Desktop/new_project
./floyd update "../new_project"  # Update that project's version of std
cd ../new_project # Go to the project

./run # Compile and run the project!
```
