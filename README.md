# pink-lang

A (kind of) functional programming language that compiles to native

## What is pink-lang?

pink-lang is a (kind of) functional programming language with incredible performance.

It's relatively high-level, but there are a few things that make it more difficult to use than some other programming languages.

Here are the draw backs.

# Drawbacks
---

## Arguments to functions are evaluated immediately

This is a problem because you cannot effectively use a function with side-effects as an argument to another function. Here's what I mean.

This code block is pointless because it evaluates both `Println` statements, then returns the result of the first one.

```fsharp
If[
	True,
	Println["Hello world!"],
	Println["Goodbye world!"]
]
```

This next code block does what we want, though.

```fsharp
Println[
	If[
		True,
		"Hello world!",
		"Goodbye world!"
	]
]
```

Great! We can use side-effects effectively now! (see what I did there)

## Function applications are all or nothing

What I mean is that, unlike in the lambda calculus, either a function can receive all of it's arguments at once, or none of them.

Here's an example.

```fsharp
func = a.b.c.(
	Print[a, b, c, "\n"]
)

main = (
	func["a", "b"] ["c"]
)
```

This code will break.

`func` must be called with _all_ of its arguments at once.

## Static typing

Each function in pink-lang has its own type. A function named `fib` would be of type `fib`, and `collatz` would be of type `collatz`. Because pink-lang is statically typed, It is impossible to have a function that has the potential to return different types during one call.

Here's an example.

```fsharp
main = (
	If[
		True,
		Print,
		Println
	] ["Hello world!"]
)
```

# Some cool things about pink-lang

## Type inference

pink-lang infers your types and automatically uses generics for each function, so you can call a function with a String, a Number, or a Function, anything really.

## Foreign Function Interface (work in progress)

Because of the format of code generated by pink-lang, it's very interoperable with C++. For example, if I wanted to create a pink-lang function in C++ that printed out a value, and returned the value, it would look like this.

```c++
// the name of the function is `Put`
class Put : public Function {
public:
    template<typename A>
    auto call(A a) {
		Println().call(a) // call pink-lang's print
        return a;
    }
};
```

If you wanted to avoid using any of pink-lang's tools, you can do it yourself.

```c++
// the name of the function is `Put`
class Put : public Function {
public:
    template<typename A>
    auto call(A a) {
		cout << a.get_data() << endl; // get data from a and print it
        return a;
    }
};
```

See how easy that was?

All you have to do to use that in pink-lang is to call it by the name `Put`!

## Simplicity and Speed

pink-lang is blazingly fast, and it's very simple too. There are only 4 datatypes: `String`, `Number`, `Pair`, and `None`.

To get command-line arguments, all one has to do is give their main function a parameter to receive them as a linked list.

```fsharp
main = your_parameter_name_here.(
	Println[your_parameter_name_here]
)
```

Super easy!

And function definitions are straight forward: just a name, an equals sign, the arguments separated by dots, and the function body. The last statement is returned at the end of the function.



# Running pink-lang

To run pink-lang, you'll need a python3 installation to freeze the compiler with pyinstaller. Once, you build the compiler for your platform, however, everything else depends on stuff that should come ready with *nix machines: `make` and `g++` with `std=c++14`.

To install pink-lang on a *nix machine _(excluding the python3 installation)_, run this.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/pink-lang # Download pink-lang
cd pink-lang

make project path="../new_project" # Make new pink-lang project in ~/Desktop/new_project
cd ../new_project # Go to the project

./run # Compile and execute the project!
```
